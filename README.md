#### TODO
* ##### Major
    * Better antispam for Kaul - maybe connecting to server?
    * Parsing Mirror's item index into the bot
    * Referencing the wiki - maybe a helper tool to generate pages?
    * Database - FIREBASE YEET
* ##### Backend
    * Make all arguments truly optional in item creation
    * Migrate off this dumb text file
    * BST or binary search for items/tags
    * Split Kaul from rest of the bot
    * Merge functions with other bots?
    * Figure out how to call async functions within other async functions - maybe some helper functions in a separate file do all the work?
    * Maybe set up a pip env for the whole project?
