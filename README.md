#### Features:

    * Adding items
    * Removing items
    * Backing up all items into a text file
    * Tagging system for items - add, remove, and modify tags
    * Looking up items
* ##### Kaul
    * Add and remove Kaul role
    * Ping system for Kaul fights
    * Antispam for Kaul pings, 5 minutes static

#### TODO
* ##### Major
    * Better antispam for Kaul - maybe connecting to server?
    * Parsing Mirror's item index into the bot
    * Referencing the wiki - maybe a helper tool to generate pages?
* ##### Backend
    * Make all arguments truly optional in item creation
    * Migrate off this dumb text file
    * BST or binary search for items/tags
    * Split Kaul from rest of the bot
    * Merge functions with other bots?
    * Figure out how to call async functions within other async functions - maybe some helper functions in a separate file do all the work?
    * Get rid of createKaul thing it's a little spooky to still have around
    * Get rid of pycache directory with a better gitignore
    * Maybe set up a pip env for the whole project?
    * Clean up backup system
